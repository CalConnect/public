# CalConnect PUBLISH Technical Committee


## Background


In its early days Calconnect developed a variety of published documents, such as reports, recommendations, use cases and requirements, proposals (experimental standards), public review documents and administrative documents. CalConnect established formal processes for development, public review, approval, registration and publishing. Over time however specifications development has largely become creating draft specifications to be submitted to the IETF (or very occasionally other groups), and the process documents for our own publishing became seriously out of date.  


CalConnect has decided to again publish its own CalConnect Standards, and to co-publish standards with other Standards Development Organizations such as ISO Technical Committees.  The processes supporting these and the process documents instantiating them need to be replaced and a committee created for ongoing management of the processes and publications.


## Charter


TC PUBLISH will be a standing committee chartered to provide recommendations to the Technical Coordination Committee and the CalConnect Board of Directors on CalConnect’s standardization and publication processes, and to develop supporting process documents. 


Initially the TC will align our existing and proposed standardization and publication processes with international best practices, such as the ISO standardization process, and the WTO’s Technical Barriers to Trade agreement.  The TC will work with the Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) to develop the standardized format for CalConnect published documents, and maintain and update CalConnect administrative and process documents as necessary.



## Deliverables


- Revised CalConnect standardization process description. The document describes the CalConnect standardization process, from conception, IPR policy, TC establishment, collaboration policies (liaisons), to the publishing of work items. Since it will also cover TCC processes, TCC’s participation will be needed. 


- A revised Calconnect Document Register scheme and naming process, or changes or additions to accommodate new and revised types of documents.


- Revised CalConnect standard document requirements. This describes the technical requirements on CalConnect standard publications, such as the sections required, boilerplate text, and formatting.


- Collaboration (dual-publishing) agreements with other partners (e.g. liaison partners). We already have a draft for ISO to co-develop (i.e. share IPR rights of deliverables) CalConnect/ISO dual published documents, this document details the methods of synchronization and roles of the collaborative parties. We should generalize this for other co-development parties in the future.


- A revised CalConnect process for developing and publishing  internal policies.
