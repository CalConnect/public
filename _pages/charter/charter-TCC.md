# CalConnect TCC Technical Coordination Committee

## Charter

The Technical Coordination Committee (TCC) (formerly TC-CHAIRS) consists of the Chairs of the active Technical Committees and functions as an ongoing status and coordination group for the Technical Committees under the guidance of the Board of Directors. The Chair of the Technical Coordination Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Chairs of the Technical Committees. The TCC meets by conference call and electronically on a regular basis as determined by the committee, generally weekly, to ensure that TC activities are monitored and guided as necessary.

* Final approval for publication of Technical Committee documents which have passed Last Call status.
* Coordination of work efforts among Technical Committees to develop documents intended in part to be submitted to an outside effort such as a working group within a standards body.
* Coordination of liaisons with external standards bodies under the guidance of the Director, External Relations.
