# CalConnect LOCALIZATION Technical Committee

## Background

Being able to read in one's own language should be a natural expectation.

## Charter

TC Localization will standardize on the approach of language localization, as
well as representation of localized objects.

The scope of localization includes, but is not limited to, transcription,
transliteration and translation systems, as applied to prosal texts, personal
and organizational names, postal addresses, as well as other relevant media of
information.

## Deliverables

- localization for JSCalendar
- vObject-i18n that introduces I18n features for vCard
- "Transcription system code" with ISO/TC 46/WG 3
- "Structured name standard" with ISO/TC 37/SC 4
- Representation of localized objects and text with ISO/TC 37/SC 5

## Begin and End Dates

* **Begin:** October 2018
* **End:** Standing Committee
