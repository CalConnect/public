# CalConnect LOCALIZATION Technical Committee

## Background

Having text presented in ones own language is both a reasonable expectation and
in some places a legal requirement.

## Charter

Enable standardization of localization technologies and approaches, and topics
relevant to the usage of localization, for digital storage and interoperability
that utilize localization.

The TC will align this work with standards being developed by other bodies such
as ISO.

The TC will identify those calendar attributes which require localization and
define an appropriate data model.

The following topics are considered out of scope:

- Consideration as to how different representations of the same attributes are
  synchronized. This is a workflow issue.

## Example use cases

The current iCalendar standards do not provide any means by which to transport
and deliver internationalized data.

Calendar data may pass through many intermediaries before reaching it's
destination, for example event aggregators.

Neither the event producers nor these intermediaries are aware of the language
of the consumer.

Public events in particular need the ability to present detailed descriptions
and summaries in the natural language of the consumer.

## Deliverables

- localization for iCalendar
- localization for JSCalendar
- CC/IETF vObject-i18n that introduces I18n features for vCard
- CC/ISO 24229 Information and documentation -- Codes for transcription systems (with ISO/TC 46/WG 3)
- CC/ISO [codename: SPN] Computer applications in terminology -- Naming --
  Structure of personal names (with ISO/TC 37/SC 4)
<!-- - Representation of localized objects and text with ISO/TC 37/SC 5 -->
- Defining a localization data model which ensures clients can present the data
  in the appropriate form.
